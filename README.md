# win10_WiFi_Grabber

This is a Rubber Ducky script. It grabs the WiFi password from a Windows 10 machine and sends it to your VPS. 

This is also my first attempt at writing Ducky Scripts. Bugs are expected. Please, let me know what can be improved. This is a work in progress...

PS: Only use it against your own Windows 10 copmputer. Do not break the law. Always be nice!
